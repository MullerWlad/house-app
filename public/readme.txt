- This project was created with gulp
- Instruments:
    - ajax(throw http request)
    - sass, pug, vue
    - bem
- This version is not adaptive, because I can't find it in terms of reference,
    but it has media queries only screen and (max-width: 800px)
- Using outputStyle: 'compressed' to reduse css code
- Using pugConverter in gulpfile, that creates .min
    - Browsersync for pug/sass
- There are no "developments" which use different images -->
    - image-adress contains only one image
        - Instrument of downloading images was not created
- I use id in ajax data to create empty forms
    - First of all, it creates empty forms. After creating it keeps data by ajax
- Before click on "see more" you can see only 12 developments on the page
- Look at dependences in gulpfile
